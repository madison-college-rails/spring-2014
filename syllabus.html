<h1>Course Materials</h1>
<hr />
<p>Here is what you will need for the course:</p>
<h2>Hardware (Yes, hardware!)</h2>
<p>Because the lab computers at <span class="caps">Madison College</span>
don&#8217;t have ruby or Rails installed,
you will need to be able to carry it with you.
Therefore, you will need <strong><span class="caps">ONE</span></strong> of the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>An external <span class="caps">USB</span> 2.0 (or 3.0) hard drive.
These are a good value right now. I like the ones that are very small
and powered by the <span class="caps">USB</span> port. Try newegg.com or shop
the sales at the area computer and electronic stores. If you already have an
external drive that needs power, that works too as there are plugs at the desks.
I will give you an Ubuntu virtual machine with Ruby and Rails pre-installed.
It will run on any computer running VMware Player, Workstation or Fusion.</li>
<li>A laptop computer of any flavor. This will may finally give you the excuse
you need to get that laptop. They have never been cheaper so go for it!
For running Rails, Macintosh laptops are smoothest, followed by Ubuntu
(or other flavor) Linux.  Installing Ruby and Rails on Windows is a challenge,
so I require Windows users to run an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine with
Ruby and Rails pre-installed.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Rails is light-weight, flexible and doesn&#8217;t require an
<span class="caps">IDE</span> (Integrated Development Environment).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this flexibility means that there is less standardization
for installing and running on the various operating systems each of the people
in the class need to run on.</p>
<p>This is painful, and difficult enough that it will be the primary goal for
our first class.  <strong>If you already have Rails comfortably installed,
please help others with your same Operating System do the same</strong>.
That way, we&#8217;ll all be able to get on with learning Rails sooner!</p>
<p>You should download the following software and put it on your laptop or
external drive and then bring it to class. If you already have a favorite text
editor then feel free to continue using it.</p>
<p>For anyone having too much difficulty getting Rails up and running on their
own hardware, I strongly recommend the Ubuntu VMWare virtual machine I provide.
That will have the advantage of more consistency, and already being ready to go,
but offset with running a heavier load on your computer.</p>
<p>We will be running Rails 4.0 to start with. We may upgrade versions of
Rails during the semester as new versions are released.</p>
<h2 style="vertical-align:middle;">Books</h2>
<p>We will be using the following books for the course. These are available
in both paper and <span class="caps">PDF</span> formats.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optional:</h3>

<h2 style="vertical-align:middle;">College Catalog and Student Handbook</h2>
<p>Many important Madison College policies and procedures are
found in the Madison College Catalog, available from the
Student Services Office. Students are expected to be familiar with such policies
and procedures, and are encouraged to retain a copy of the Handbook for reference
as needed during their attendance at Madison College.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 style="vertical-align:middle;">Withdrawal Policy</h2>
<p>If a situation arises that prevents the successful completion of this course,
please note that it is each student's responsibility to formally withdraw from
this course. In the past, an instructor was allowed to withdraw a student who
was no longer attending class, but this is now prohibited!
</p><p>

<b>My Madison College</b> or initiate the proper action in the Business and
Applied Arts Office (Room D3631 (369) - 246-6003).</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="vertical-align:middle;">Attendance</h2>
Madison College does not have an attendance requirement, but you will likely
have difficulty succeeding in this class without regular attendance.  Falling
behind is the number one reason students drop this course.
<hr />
<h2 style="vertical-align:middle;">Use of Electronic Devices</h2>
Use of Electronic Devices: Please silence cell phones during class time out of
courtesy to your classmates. Use of all electronic devices other than your
computer is strictly prohibited during in-class exams.
<hr />

<hr />
<h2 style="vertical-align:middle;">Projects</h2>
There are fifteen units in the course. For each four to five units there will
be a project worth 20 points. The projects will always be due by the next
class period after the last unit for that project is finished.
The projects will be submitted electronically as a zipped (compressed) archive
through the course Blackboard website. Instructions for zipping and submitting
your projects are addressed in another course document.
</p><p>
An individual instructor may have a different submission prodecure
which supersedes this one.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Late Project Policy</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
The maximum point total that a project is worth is based on when
the project is submitted in comparison to the due date for the project.
The late penalty is assessed at the rate of 0.4 points per day. The
following table lists maximum point totals:

<h3><strong>In-class Labs</strong></h3>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3><strong>In-class Labs Grading</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
In-class labs are normally done during scheduled class time.</li>
<li>
To get the full 2 points you must fully complete the lab and
be checked off by the instructor.</li>
<li>
In-class labs that are missed can be made up outside of class
time provided the student makes arrangements with the instructor.
</li>
<li>
The total number of points that can be earned for in-class
labs is 50 to 60.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

personal electronic devices is prohibited during in-class exams.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Exam Grading Policy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You must receive a cumulative passing grade on all the exams
during the semester. The two exams total 100 points and you must have
